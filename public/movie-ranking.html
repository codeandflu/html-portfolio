<h2>My Top 3 movies of All Time</h2><br>
<hr>
<h3>Silence of the lambs</h3>
<p>Movie is about a psychopath who kills women to steal their flush to make a dress for himself. The thing I liked the most about the movie is the actor who played hannibal lecter, although he has a guest appearance in the movie his presence is seen through out the movie</p>
<br>
<h3>Grand Budapest hotel</h3>
<p>Movie about a hotel manager and a bell boy. I love the movie because the effort the director Wes Anserson has put into each shot to bring a symmetrical perfection to each frame</p>
<br>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>I love the movie for the theatre experience the movie provides, sound first class, visuals first class</p>
